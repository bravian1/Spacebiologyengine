## Getting Started

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Google API Key** (for Gemini AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bravian1/Spacebiologyengine.git
cd Spacebiologyengine
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Setup](#environment-setup))

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key (required for AI features)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Optional: Firebase configuration (if using Firebase features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

To get a Google API Key:
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to your `.env.local` file

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`** - Start development server on port 9002 with Turbopack
- **`npm run build`** - Build the production application
- **`npm run start`** - Start the production server
- **`npm run lint`** - Run ESLint to check code quality
- **`npm run typecheck`** - Run TypeScript compiler to check types
- **`npm run genkit:dev`** - Start Genkit development server
- **`npm run genkit:watch`** - Start Genkit with hot reload

## How It Works

### 1. Data Integration
AstroBioChat integrates with NASA's OSDR API to fetch metadata about space biology studies, including experiment details, research personnel, publications, and associated data files.

### 2. AI-Powered Chat
The chat interface uses Google's Gemini models through Genkit to:
- Answer questions about space biology research
- Provide context-aware responses based on OSDR data
- Generate summaries of complex scientific metadata
- Stream responses in real-time for better UX

### 3. Search & Discovery
Users can search and filter studies by:
- Keywords and titles
- Study types and organisms
- Date ranges
- Missions and experiments

### 4. Data Visualization
Interactive charts and visualizations help users understand:
- Distribution of file types in studies
- Personnel roles and contributions
- Study metadata at a glance

## API Routes

The application exposes the following API endpoints:

- **`/api/genkit`** - Genkit AI integration endpoint for chat functionality
- Additional API routes may be added as the project evolves

## Deployment

### Firebase App Hosting

The project includes an `apphosting.yaml` configuration file for deployment to Firebase App Hosting.

```bash
# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

### Vercel

This Next.js app can also be easily deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please ensure your code:
- Passes TypeScript type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
- Passes linting (`npm run lint`)
- Follows the existing code style
- Includes appropriate documentation
